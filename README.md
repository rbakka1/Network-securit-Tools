# Network Security and Packet-Based Projects

This repository contains various network security and packet-based projects, focusing on the analysis and manipulation of network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

## Protocol-Based Projects

These projects analyze the behavior of TCP and UDP protocols in network communication.

### TCP Session Establishment and Termination
- **Objective**: Learn TCP session establishment (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and termination (FIN, FIN-ACK, ACK).
- **Tools Used**: Wireshark, Web Browser
- **Outcome**: Documented the process of establishing and terminating a reliable TCP connection.

### UDP Session Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand session-like behavior in UDP communication despite its connectionless nature.
- **Tools Used**: Wireshark, nslookup
- **Outcome**: Analyzed UDP packets and compared them with TCP's session management.
